		<h1>Camelot is Bad</h1>
		<p class="summary">TL;DR: Think twice before renting a property from or associated with Camelot. They severely disadvantage tenants and systematically seek the boundaries of the tenancy law.</p>
		
		<p>In recent years Camelot has been regularly discredited by serious malpractices in their business operations of renting out properties to - often vulnerable - tenants. Problems range from not paying back deposits after the termination of a lease, charging wrongful service costs to poor or no maintenance of properties.</p>
		
		<p>This overview serves as a warning for people who intend to rent a property from Camelot. As a former tenant, I strongly advise you not to rent a property from them.</p>
